# New IVIVE Approach
## Overview
This repository contains a pharmacokinetic model developed using the **nlmixr2** package to describe the time-dependent concentration changes of **diclofenac** and its primary metabolite, **4-hydroxy diclofenac**. The model is based on experimental data obtained from a patented Korean biomimetic *in vitro* system that enables simultaneous assessment of drug transport and cellular metabolism.

**R Shiny-based simulator is available at:** https://seongwonpark0122.shinyapps.io/New-IVIVE-approach/

## Experimental System
The data used for model development were generated using a novel biomimetic *in vitro* system with the following features:
- **Single-well plate design** with integrated porous mesh insert
- **Magnetic stirrer** positioned at the center to create dynamic media flow
- **Cell culture compartment** within the insert for metabolic capability assessment
- **Simultaneous monitoring** of parent drug (diclofenac) and metabolite (4-hydroxy diclofenac) concentrations

## Model Features
- **nlmixr2-based modeling**: Robust population pharmacokinetic modeling framework
- **Dual compound tracking**: Simultaneous modeling of diclofenac and 4-hydroxy diclofenac kinetics
- **Biomimetic data integration**: Model parameters derived from patented Korean *in vitro* system
